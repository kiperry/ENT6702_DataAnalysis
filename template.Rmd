```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.pos = "!H",  fig.width=5, fig.height=3,
                      echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE)
# r setup = r setup # (see at top of chunk) this is just the name of this chunk. Each chunk within a script needs a unique name
# include = FALSE # prevents code and the associated results from appearing in the finished output file (e.g., PDF). R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.
# NOTE: all of these options could be changed chunk by chunk...but I am specifying global options here (i.e., applied to all chunks) using "opts_chunk$set"
# fig.pos = "!H" # prevents the figures from "floating" (moving into weird locations as R tries to organize the output file)
# fig.width, fig.height # size of figures in inches
# echo = FALSE prevents code, but not the output, from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.
# eval = TRUE # run the code in the chunks

@. Question 1
    ```{r Question 1}
useful_code1 <- c(1,10,12,2,4)
    ```

@. Question 2 (Note: Make sure to rename the chunk!)
    ```{r Question 2}
useful_code2 <- 20:24
    ```


@. Question 3 (for plotting)
    ```{r Question 3, fig.pos = 'h',fig.align="center", eval=T, echo=T, include=T}
plot(useful_code2~useful_code1)
    ```
